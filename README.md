SSE635.GeneticAlgorithm
=======================

Project for Advanced Computational Techniques course

The computer will genrate several strings containing randomly selected lowercase letters of the english alphabet. The computer will then attempt to reach a solution in which the letters are in proper alphabetical order. A genetic algorithm will be developed to find this solution and to determine how many generations, or how long it takes for the computer to find the solution.
